### Introduction

We will cover in this section the framework in which RL is based on, which is
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We will introduce the concepts of Markov Processes (MPs), then add rewards for Markov Reward Processes, and finally add actions into the mix for MDPs. Finally, we will see an example of a simple MDP (based on David Silver's RL course), its python implementation and analyze it in a bit more detail.

### Sequential Decision Making and Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning can be described as learning by trial and error, and the performance of an agent is given by the environment according to how this agent acts in each time step. The agents then has to decide how to act sequentially, taking into account that previous actions/configurations/states can lead to different results.
