    "\n",
    "* Because of this interaction, the environment returns back some information about how well this information went, namely the reward signal $r_{t+1}$ (a random variable from a distribution $R$), and the next state the agent landed $s_{t+1}$, by means of the dynamics of the environment (which can be modeled as $P(s^{'} | s, a)$).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Here we are discounting with a factor of $\\gamma$ to make the sum bounded, and mostly to make the math work. Also, as described earlier, $r$ is a random variable, so the return is also a random variable. Because of this, we objective of the agent is to maximize the **Expected Return** :\n",

    "* The agent in state $s$ from $S$ picks an action $a$ from $A$.\n",

If this observations are not sufficient to compute the future states, then the environment is said to be **Partially observable**, and we are in the case of a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process)\n",
    "* Usually, to avoid this, the state representation given to the agent is made such that it can have enough information to satisfy this property (state augmentation), and usually this works well in Deep RL.\n"

So the agent has to pick actions accordingly. The agent has to pick an action in every environment step, so we can formulate this decision as a mapping : for a given state/configuration $s_{t}$ the agent is currently in, the agent chooses an action $a_{t}$.
